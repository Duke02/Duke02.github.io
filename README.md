# The Duke's Website

Hello I am Trystan May, a software engineer / Machine Learning enthusiast. I graduated from the University of Alabama in Huntsville
with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science in May 2021. I play bass, I love dogs, and I try my best.

## Current Projects

### Over-engineered Budgeting Program

I desperately need to learn how to budget so hopefully an over-engineered data science project will help me have fun with being responsible.

### Spotify Listening Analysis

I recently (March 18th, 2021) downloaded my Spotify data for the past year, so time to analyze the h*ck out of it.
